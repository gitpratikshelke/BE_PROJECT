# MemeShield - Multimodal Content Moderation System for Detecting Toxic Memes

## Overview
MemeShield is an advanced multimodal content moderation system designed to detect toxic memes using both textual and visual analysis. The system integrates **EasyOCR, LXMERT, and ResNet** to efficiently extract and analyze text from images while evaluating their content for toxicity. The project achieves an **accuracy of 75-80%** in detecting harmful content, ensuring a safer digital environment.

## Features
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Utilizes text and image data for more accurate toxicity detection.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 75-80% detection accuracy using advanced deep learning models.
- **Efficient OCR Integration**: Uses EasyOCR for robust text extraction from memes.
- **Flask-Based Deployment**: Offers a user-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
- **Optimized Backend**: Python-based optimizations improve performance by 30%.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: EasyOCR
- **Multimodal Model**: LXMERT (Language and Vision Model)
- **Image Processing**: ResNet
- **Web Framework**: Flask

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.8)
- Pip
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MemeShield.git
cd MemeShield

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Running the Flask App
```bash
python app.py
```
Access the web interface at **http://127.0.0.1:5000/**

### Detecting Toxic Memes
1. Upload an image containing a meme.
2. The system extracts text and analyzes the image.
3. A toxicity score is generated along with a classification (safe or toxic).
4. Results are displayed on the web interface.

## Model Architecture
### Text Extraction
- **EasyOCR** extracts text from memes.
- Preprocessing is done to remove noise.

### Image Analysis
- **ResNet** extracts deep visual features from memes.

### Multimodal Fusion
- **LXMERT** processes both textual and visual features together to determine toxicity.

### Classification
- The extracted text and image features are passed through a deep learning classifier to predict toxicity.

## Performance
- Accuracy: **75-80%**
- Backend Optimization: **30% boost in efficiency**

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time meme scanning in social media platforms.
- Improve text-based analysis using large language models (LLMs).
- Deploy as a cloud-based moderation service.
